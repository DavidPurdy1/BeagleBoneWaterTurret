# Beagle Bone Sentry Gun

This project is going to use facial recognition to recognize a face and see if that persons mouth is open. If so, it is going to move the servo arm and use a DC pump to pump water and shoot it into the persons mouth. The entire base will be on a swivel to patrol a field of view.
