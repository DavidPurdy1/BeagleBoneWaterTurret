# BeagleBone AI-64 Water Gun Sentry Turret
## Sophia Harrison and David Purdy

This project uses facial recognition to recognize a face and see if that persons mouth is open. If so, it moves the servo arm and uses a DC pump to pump wate and shoot it into the persons mouth. The entire base is on a swivel to patrol a field of view. The end of the water gun nosle is attached to a servo motor in order to create the correct angle to shoot the water into the mouth.
